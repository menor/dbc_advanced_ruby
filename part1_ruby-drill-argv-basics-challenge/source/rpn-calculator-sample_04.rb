# REVIEW/REFLECT
# Reflection is vital to learning and growth. These challenges should not be thought of as items
# to check off;  they are your opportunities to learn and grow as a programmer.
# Use the following questions to reflect on this challenge.
# Was your strategy for solving the challenge successful?
# What part of your strategy worked? What parts were challenging?
# What questions did you have while coding? Did you find answers to them?
# Are there any concepts that are still confusing to you?
# Did you learn any new skills or ruby tricks?

# INCLUDE REFLECTION HERE:
# I think the most frustrating part was finding a solution that I
# thought worked and then realized that I was incorrect. Trying to
# continuing to code being very dry.
